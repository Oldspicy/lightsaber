Code is functional.  The '.wav' references are the sound files I added to the microSD card.

Ignore the batteryCheck function.  That's something I was working on, but it wasn't performing as well as I had hoped so the necessary hardware isn't included in the schematic.  It originally used a voltage divider off of the power rail and measured with an analog pin on the teensy.
